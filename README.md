# march-madness-bracket
Created in March of 2023, these two programs were made for fun and to pick a bracket for March Madness. They were also used to eliminate bias in the event that certain teams were favorited by a person picking the winners. Both prgrams utilize the same algorithm which uses a combination of real statistical data scraped from https://www.betfirm.com/seeds-national-championship-odds/ and random numbers.

Use RoundOf64.java to run a simulation of the round of 64 and get the result of every game from the first round printed in a readable format

Use GamePicker.java to find the winner of individual games, based on user inputted seeds and round number. This program can be used for every round of the tournament and any combination of seeds.
